# The Raid On Mora
The diplomma game, created together with Marianna Grabowska - work very much in progress.

Due to the weirdness with GitHub (or maybe just my inability to use it properly), I had to copy most files without the Assets folder that normally contained them. As such, the following files and folders must be placed into an Assets folder: 

Folders: 
* Scripts
* Ability Icons
* Scenes
* Editor
* Fonts
* Prefabs

Files:
* smudge
* placeholder
* ringaling
* Spawnpoint
